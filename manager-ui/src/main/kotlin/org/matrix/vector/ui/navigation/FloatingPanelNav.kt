 * Not a [androidx.compose.foundation.layout.BoxScope] extension and it takes no `Alignment`: it
 * fills the space it is given and places the ball itself, because the arc has to know the window it
 * must stay inside, and an alignment handed in from outside would describe the ball while telling
 * this nothing about the room left around it.
 *
 * It is drawn inside the app window, as the last child of the shell's content Box. Never a `Popup`,
 * never a `Dialog`, and above all never a system overlay: parasitically this app *is*
 * `com.android.shell`, and a manager that asked for `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` would be asking the
 * shell's uid for permission to draw over every other app on the device. A floating control is
 * worth exactly none of that.
 *
 * It reads `WindowInsets.safeDrawing` itself, as bounds rather than as padding: with the navigation
 * container set to `NavigationSuiteType.None` the scaffold consumes no insets at all, so nothing
 * above this has reserved the system bars and the ball would otherwise park itself under the
 * gesture handle. Bounds rather than padding because the tap that dismisses the open arc has to
 * cover the whole window, insets included, while the ball itself must stay out of them.
 *
 * Two ways in, on purpose. Holding the ball blooms the arc and the same finger picks from it, which
 * is the fast one; a plain tap latches the arc open so each panel is an ordinary target, which is
 * the only one a screen reader can use. A drag-only selector is unreachable by touch exploration,
 * so the latched path is not polish — it is the accessible path, and every fanned panel is its own
 * focusable, clickable node with its own description rather than a hit test over one canvas.
