/**
 * A maze, with something finding its way through it.
 *
 * The opposite of the circuit beside it, and that is the point of having both: a circuit is a
 * designed path that many signals share, a maze is an undesigned one that a single wanderer has to
 * solve. A pulse choosing at random on a trace reads as a fault; a wanderer choosing at random in a
 * maze is the whole idea.
 *
 * Carved rather than sprinkled — see [build] — then braided open, because a perfect maze is all
 * dead ends and a wanderer in one mostly reverses. **Several openings on both edges** mean there is
 * never one true path and its choices are never forced.
 *
 * **One wanderer at a time.** It enters at an opening, turns at random wherever it has a choice,
 * and only when it leaves through some other opening does the next one set out. Several at once
 * read as traffic, and the point of the thing is watching a single decision being made and then
 * another.
 *
 * Tap to drop the wanderer where you touched. Swipe for a different maze.
