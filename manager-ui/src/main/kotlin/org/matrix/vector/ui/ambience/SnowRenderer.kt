/**
 * Snowfall you can pick apart.
 *
 * Flakes are drawn as actual six-armed crystals — three crossed arms with a pair of barbs on each,
 * slowly rotating — rather than dots. A dot field reads as static; a crystal reads as a snowflake
 * even at eight pixels across, and the slow spin is what sells it.
 *
 * Two things answer a touch, and which one you get depends on whether you hit anything:
 * - **On a flake:** it bursts. The six arms detach, spin outward and fade over about a second, and
 *   the flake is gone. Slow on purpose — a fast pop would read as a glitch rather than an event.
 * - **On empty space:** a new flake *grows* there from nothing over a second and a half, then
 *   joins the fall. So the field is something you can prune and reseed rather than only disturb.
