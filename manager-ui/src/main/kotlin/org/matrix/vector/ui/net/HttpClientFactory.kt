/**
 * The one HTTP client the manager uses, for the module store, the GitHub feed and avatars alike.
 *
 * Two things it must get right:
 * - **A disk cache.** Every remote surface renders from cache first and treats the network as an
 *   upgrade, because the manager is routinely opened with no connectivity. The cache also makes
 *   GitHub's conditional requests cheap: a `304 Not Modified` does not count against the 60
 *   requests/hour an unauthenticated client gets, so revalidation is effectively free.
 * - **DNS over HTTPS, as a fallback rather than a replacement.** Users on censored networks cannot
 *   resolve the module repository or GitHub over plain DNS. See [VectorDns] for why it must never
 *   be the only path: a network that blocks Cloudflare as well would then leave the Store
 *   permanently empty.
