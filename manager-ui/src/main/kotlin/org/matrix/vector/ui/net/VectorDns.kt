/**
 * Name resolution: DNS over HTTPS when it helps, the system resolver when it does not.
 *
 * DoH exists here for users whose network will not resolve the module repository or GitHub over
 * plain DNS. It is deliberately **best-effort** rather than all-or-nothing, because the networks
 * that make the setting worth having are also the ones that may block `cloudflare-dns.com` itself,
 * and a lookup path with no fallback would then take the module list, the activity feed and every
 * avatar down together — leaving the switch that caused it as the only way out. So:
 * - a failed DoH lookup falls through to the system resolver rather than failing the request;
 * - the first failure latches for the session, so the timeout is paid once and not per lookup;
 * - the DoH client's own timeouts are short, so that one payment is a few seconds, not fifteen;
 * - a configured HTTP proxy disables DoH entirely, because the proxy is doing the resolving and
 *   bootstrap IPs are meaningless to it.
 *
 * Every one of those branches used to be invisible: off, bypassed and latched all looked like the
 * same working switch, and the fallback existed only as a log line. [status] is what each lookup
 * did, so the sheet that owns the switch can say which of them is happening.
 *
 * The setting and the proxy are both read **per lookup** rather than baked into the client at
 * construction. OkHttp cannot have its DNS swapped on a live client, and rebuilding the shared
 * client would drop the connection pool and orphan the disk cache, so reading them here is what
 * lets a switch — or joining a VPN — take effect before the next process start.
