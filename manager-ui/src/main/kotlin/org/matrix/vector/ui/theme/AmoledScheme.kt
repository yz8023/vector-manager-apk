/**
 * Collapses every background role to true black, for OLED panels.
 *
 * Applied on top of whichever dark scheme is in use — including a dynamic one — so the accent
 * colours the user's wallpaper produced survive.
 *
 * Which palette is in force is never the app's choice: from API 31 the wallpaper decides it, and
 * below that, or whenever the user turns dynamic colour off, the seed they picked does. So nothing
 * may rely on a specific hue to carry meaning — the status header and version mark carry state by
 * shape, icon, label and motion as well as by colour.
