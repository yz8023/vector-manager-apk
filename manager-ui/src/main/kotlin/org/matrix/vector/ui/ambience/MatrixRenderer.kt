/**
 * Falling code.
 *
 * Columns of glyphs descending at their own speeds, each with a bright head and a tail that dims
 * behind it, and glyphs that occasionally flip to something else mid-fall — the flicker is what
 * makes it read as *code* rather than as text scrolling past.
 *
 * Three ways to interact, and the point of all of them is that the rain is normally too fast to
 * read:
 * - **Hold** and it stops dead. The whole field freezes so it can actually be read, and the glyph
 *   under your finger is lifted out of the column — drawn larger and brighter, held between the
 *   fingertip and the surface it came from. Let go and it drops back and the rain resumes.
 * - **Pinch** to change the glyph size. Larger glyphs mean fewer, wider columns and a rain that can
 *   be read at a glance; smaller ones mean a dense fine drizzle. It is a scale, not a camera: a
 *   flat field of text has no parallax cues, so a simulated approach reads as the columns sliding
 *   sideways.
 * - **Tap** to seed a new column at that point, so a bare stretch can be filled in.
