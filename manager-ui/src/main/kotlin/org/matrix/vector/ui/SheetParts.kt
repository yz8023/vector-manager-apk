/**
 * The three pieces every settings sheet in this app is built from.
 *
 * Shared rather than copied into each sheet, because copies drift and two sheets end up looking
 * *almost* the same — the tell is a heading indented differently, or a switch row whose subtitle
 * wraps at another width. A new sheet inherits the pattern, and changing the pattern changes every
 * sheet at once.
 */

/**
 * What a [ListItem] needs to be given to sit on a sheet.
 *
 * A list item's container defaults to `surface`; a `ModalBottomSheet` is drawn on
 * `surfaceContainerLow`, which is a shade darker. On a screen those two agree, so the default looks
 * right in the place a row is usually written and wrong the moment it is put in a sheet — a pale
 * full-width band across the sheet, ending wherever the row ends. Transparent takes whatever it is
 * placed on, so it is right in both, and it is what every list item in a sheet should be given.
