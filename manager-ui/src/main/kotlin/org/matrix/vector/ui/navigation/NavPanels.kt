 * that the bar, the floating ball and the appearance sheet cannot each remember a different half of
 * it: [visible] is never empty, [start] is the first visible panel rather than Home, and
 * [withHidden] refuses to hide the last one standing. A surface that asks the right question here
 * cannot produce a state the rest of the app has no answer for.
 *
 * [order] holds every panel, hidden ones included. Hiding is the reader's opinion of the container
 * and not a deletion — a panel that is not drawn still needs its route type and its registration
 * with whatever renders the stack, because a stack saved before it was hidden still names it.
