/**
 * A stack trace, read as a list rather than as a wall of text.
 *
 * A trace is already a structured thing — a chain of throwables, each with a list of frames — and
 * printing it as one string is a format for a terminal, not for a screen someone is scrolling on a
 * phone. Rendered as rows it can do what the text cannot: mark the frames that belong to this
 * project, separate the name of a method from the file it lives in, and let one frame be lifted to
 * the clipboard without a text selection.
 *
 * Two things are deliberate about the emphasis. The frames in **our** code are the ones a reader is
 * looking for and the platform's are context, so ours carry the weight and a filled marker while
 * the platform's are dimmed — the opposite of the printed order, where the platform usually comes
 * first. And the chain reads downwards to the *root* cause: `printStackTrace` puts the outermost
 * throwable at the top, but "Caused by" is where the answer is, so each cause is introduced by a
 * divider rather than buried in the run of frames.
 *
 * Emits a plain column of rows and takes no scrolling of its own, so a caller can drop it into a
 * `LazyColumn` item, a card, or an expanded log row without fighting a nested scroll. Long traces
 * belong in [stackTraceItems] instead, which spends the caller's lazy list on them.
