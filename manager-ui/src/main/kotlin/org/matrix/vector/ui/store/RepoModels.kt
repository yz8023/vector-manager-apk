/**

 * These mirror what the server actually sends, measured against a live `modules.json` of 809
 * entries. Two things shape the file:
 *
 * **Nullability is not decoration here.** `scope` is null on 506 of the 809 entries, `sourceUrl` on
 * 369 and `summary` on 121. Gson constructs through `Unsafe` and runs neither Kotlin's
 * default-argument logic nor its null checks, so a non-null type on a field the server omits yields
 * a `null` that only explodes at the first dereference, far from the parse. Every field the payload
 * does not guarantee is therefore declared optional.
 *
 * **The list payload is nearly a detail payload.** Each list entry already carries exactly one
 * release — the newest — with its `.apk` asset and download URL. Installing the current version of
 * a module needs no second request, which is what lets the Store work on a bad connection.

 *
 * That difference is the whole reason this is recorded. The comparison above believes the tag, and

 * the two disagree the offer cannot be satisfied by taking it: installing leaves the device on a
 * version the tag still claims to beat, so the row asks again, and again, for ever.
 *
 * Nor can it be settled by reading the two numbers harder, because both halves of the comparison
 * are load-bearing for someone: a module that never changes its tag code is only ever seen to
 * update through the name clause, and one that reuses a versionName across several codes only
 * through the code clause. Any rule over `(code, name)` is wrong for one of them.
 *
 * So the Store stops inferring and records instead. An offer it has already installed, on a device
 * still reporting what that install produced, is one the reader has taken.
 *
 * [installed] is what makes the record expire on its own: it is checked against what the device
 * reports now, so a module replaced from anywhere else stops matching and the offer comes back.
