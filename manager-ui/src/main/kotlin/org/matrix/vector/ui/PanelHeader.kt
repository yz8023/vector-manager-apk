/**
 * The top of a list panel, as three rows of fixed height.
 *
 * Modules, Store and Logs are the same kind of screen — a title, a few actions, one line of state,
 * a search field and a long list — so they share one header rather than each growing its own.
 * Headers of three different heights move the search field as tabs are switched, and that is the
 * one control a thumb learns the position of: moving it is felt long before it is noticed.
 *
 * So the whole block is laid out here, at a **fixed height**, including the search field: a title
 * row that may carry actions on the right, a line of description under it, and the field. Fixing the
 * height rather than measuring it is what makes the layout predictable — a description that appears
 * only once a catalogue has loaded, or a line counter that is empty until a log is read, then costs
 * nothing below it and shifts nothing.
 *
 * The scope editor deliberately does not use this. It is a screen you arrive at and leave again, so
 * it carries a back arrow and the name of what you came for, and the shape of the panels you
 * navigate *between* is the wrong shape for it.
