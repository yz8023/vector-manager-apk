/**
 * `API 101` / `Xposed 93`, with the scale name small and quiet and the number carrying the colour.
 *
 * The scale name is context that rarely changes and repeats down every row; the number is the fact
 * being checked, so it is the only part given weight and colour. A caller with no value to show
 * passes `"?"` for [value] and `incompatible = true`, which keeps the badge the same shape while the
 * missing number reads as missing rather than as a different kind of thing.
 *
 * Model-agnostic on purpose: Vector maps a module's declared API into ([label], [value]); LSPatch
 * passes its own text. Both get one badge instead of two that drift apart.
