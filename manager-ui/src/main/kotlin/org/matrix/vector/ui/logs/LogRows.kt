/**
 * Horizontal panning shared by every row of a log.
 *
 * Neither `Modifier.horizontalScroll` on the `LazyColumn` nor a shared `ScrollState` on the rows
 * will do, and for the same reason: both derive the pan extent from whatever is currently measured.
 * A lazy list only measures its visible window, and a `ScrollState` holds one `maxValue` that the
 * last row to measure wins — so scrolling vertically brings a longer line into the window, the
 * extent is recomputed, and the clamp on the current offset moves under the reader's finger.
 *
 * So the offset lives here, and the extent is the **running maximum** of every row width measured
 * so far. It only ever grows while a window is on screen, which is what makes it impossible for a
 * newly composed row to yank the content sideways. It restarts when the reading changes — see
 * [reportRow] for why that restart has to be lazy.

 * filter to itself; then the message. `uid:pid:tid` are twenty-two columns wide and are what forces
 * sideways panning, so they hide behind a tap.
 *
 * All of it is **one** styled `Text` rather than a `Row` of cells. Cells confine the message to
 * whatever the metadata leaves over, which on a phone is a narrow column beside a mostly empty
 * gutter; as one string the message wraps under the metadata and uses the full width. The cost is
 * that the tag is not a `Chip` with its own click target, so the tap is resolved against the text
 * layout instead — see [tagRangeOf].
