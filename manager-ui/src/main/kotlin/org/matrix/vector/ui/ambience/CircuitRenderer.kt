/**
 * Signal traces.
 *
 * The most on-theme of the set: this app manages a framework that injects code into running
 * processes, and the header quietly draws the picture of that — faint traces, and a touch that
 * sends a **pulse travelling down the nearest one**, lighting the trace ahead of it and leaving it
 * dark behind.
 *
 * The board is *routed* rather than drawn. Traces run along the lanes of a lattice and step between
 * neighbouring lanes at its columns, and every run they occupy is claimed, so no two are ever drawn
 * along the same line — which is the whole difference between a board and a plate of spaghetti.
 * Crossings are welcome, though: a trace that meets copper already laid steps aside and carries on
 * over it, the way a board uses its layers, and every trace is routed through to the right-hand
 * side rather than being allowed to peter out somewhere in the middle. Corners are mitred, because
 * a right angle is the one thing a real router never leaves behind: copper turns through two 45°
 * elbows.
 *
 * The signal itself is a swell of light travelling along the copper: widest and brightest under its
 * head and drawn down to nothing behind, breathing a little as it goes — the one thing on the board
 * that is not still.
 *
 * Swipe sideways to route a fresh board, up and down to change how fast the signals run.
