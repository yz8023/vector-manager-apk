 * registry the handshake built, so a caller can only ever act as itself. {@link #isLogMuted} is the
 * exception and is deliberately unauthenticated: it discloses one global boolean about log
 * verbosity, and it is asked before a process has anything to be authenticated as.</p>
 *

 * anywhere above renumbers every method after it, and the daemon and the injected processes are
 * only guaranteed to agree because they ship in the same zip.</p>
