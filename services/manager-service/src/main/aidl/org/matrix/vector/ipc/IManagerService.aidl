/**
 * What the manager app asks the daemon for, once the framework has pushed it a binder.
 *
 * <p>Runs in the daemon, as root. Everything here is here because the manager cannot do it for
 * itself: it is either the framework's own configuration and state, which nothing else holds, or a
 * call into a system service that an ordinary app is not allowed to make.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Authenticated once, by possession.</b> This binder is registered nowhere.
 * {@code IFrameworkService.requestManagerService} answers with it only for the pid the daemon
 * launched the manager into, or for the uid of the installed manager package, and the injected
 * framework then pushes it into that process by reflection. No method below re-checks its caller,
 * and none needs to - the decision was taken when the binder was handed over. The consequence is
 * that a process holding this binder holds the daemon's authority over the whole device, so it must
 * never be published to servicemanager and never passed on.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The fully qualified name of this interface is its binder descriptor, and the two ends can
 * be different builds.</b> {@link #getManagerApk} exists so the manager can be installed as an
 * ordinary app, and an installed copy survives every later flash of the framework. Nothing about
 * that failure is loud: the generated {@code Stub.asInterface} wraps any binder in a proxy without
 * checking anything, the binder stays alive so {@code isBinderAlive()} keeps answering true, and
 * every transaction then throws {@code SecurityException} out of {@code Parcel.enforceInterface}
 * before its transaction code is even read - so the manager draws a framework that is plainly
 * running as one that answers nothing, on every screen, with nothing said. The manager therefore
 * compares {@code IBinder.getInterfaceDescriptor()} against its own compiled {@code DESCRIPTOR} the
 * moment the binder arrives and before any transaction. That one question is exempt by
 * construction - {@code INTERFACE_TRANSACTION} sits outside
 * {@code FIRST_CALL_TRANSACTION..LAST_CALL_TRANSACTION}, which is the range the generated
 * dispatcher checks the interface token for - so it is answered across any mismatch, and it names
 * the build on the other end.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Transaction ids are implicit, and {@link #getProtocolVersion} is what makes that safe.</b>
 * They are assigned in declaration order, so adding, removing or reordering a method shifts every
 * id below it - and unlike the descriptor, nothing about that shift is visible to a peer built
 * against a different revision. It would simply call a different method than it meant to. That is
 * what numbering the methods by hand used to guard against, at the price of a number beside every
 * one of them and a hole beside every one retired.</p>
 *
 * <p>A version handshake guards the same thing better. {@link #getProtocolVersion} is declared
 * first, so it is transaction zero whatever else changes, and it is the first call the manager
 * makes. A peer that disagrees is refused outright rather than left to call methods whose meaning
 * has moved under it - which is what the numbers permitted: id 33 of the interface this replaces
 * carried {@code setHiddenIcon(boolean hide)} and then {@code setForcedLauncherIcons(boolean force)},
 * the same number with the argument's sense inverted, and every old peer went on calling it and
 * asking for the opposite of what it meant.</p>
 *
 * <p>So the rule is not "append only". It is: change this file however the design wants, and bump
 * {@link #PROTOCOL_VERSION} in the same commit.</p>
 *
 * <p>A {@code boolean} returned by a write means <i>the daemon stored it</i>, not <i>the call
 * arrived</i>. Each such method says what a {@code false} means; ignoring it turns a refusal into a
 * silent success. None of them means "the value was already that": writing a value a row already
 * holds still answers true.</p>
