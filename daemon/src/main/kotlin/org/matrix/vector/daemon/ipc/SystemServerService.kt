 * every type a method mentions when it verifies that method, not when the branch mentioning it
 * runs. Spelling the callback out inside [SystemServerService] therefore made the daemon's very
 * first call fail to resolve `IServiceCallback$Stub` on Android 9 and log a NoClassDefFoundError,
 * even though the version gate meant that code was never executed (issue #925). Behind a separate
 * class the resolution is deferred to this object's initialization, which the gate skips on older
