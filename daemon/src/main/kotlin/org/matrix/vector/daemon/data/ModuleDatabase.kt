/**
 * The module configuration: what the user asked for.
 *
 * This is the source of truth, and the only thing here that talks to the database. It answers the
 * questions a manager asks — is this module enabled, what is its scope, does it auto-include — and
 * it performs every write.
 *
 * The distinction from [ConfigCache] is the whole point of splitting them, and getting it wrong has
 * already cost one bug. There are two different notions of "module" in this daemon:
 *
 *  * **Configuration**, here: what was asked for. Cheap, transactional, and it must always answer a
 *    reader with the reader's own writes already applied.
 *  * **Realisation**, in [ConfigCache]: what can actually be loaded into a process right now — the
 *    resolved APK path, the parsed DEX, the app id. Expensive to build (package manager calls, zip
 *    reads and DEX parsing; measured at 39 ms for five modules) and therefore rebuilt off the
 *    binder thread, coalesced, and *eventually* consistent.
 *
 * `enabledModules()` used to be answered from the realisation, which is a configuration question
 * asked of a store that is allowed to lag. The manager enabled a module, read back immediately, and
 * was told the state from before its own write. Every other configuration query already read the
 * database; that one line was the outlier, which is why the symptom was so hard to place.
 *
 * The database handle lives here rather than in the cache so the dependency points the right way:
 * the realisation is derived *from* the configuration, and a config query cannot be written inside
 * the cache without deliberately reaching over here for a database to use.
