/**
 * Which build this is, in one string: what commit it came from and where it was built.
 *
 * The version code is the commit count on origin/master, so every branch build carries master's
 * number: a build flashed from a feature branch and one flashed from master both report "v2.0
 * (3052)" and cannot be told apart on the device. That is not hypothetical — it cost a real
 * investigation to establish which of the two was installed.
 *
 * **The commit always comes first, and what follows always says where.** Both readers of this
 * string want the commit and nothing else — the manager compares it against the SHA a release was
 * cut from to answer "am I running this build", and the status page sets it in a type the rest is
 * not given — and for both it is now simply the head of the string. No rule has to work out which
 * part is which, so none can get it wrong when a repository or a machine turns out to have a hyphen
 * in its name.
 *
 * The separator says which kind of "where" follows, because they mean opposite things about whether
 * the commit describes the binary:
 *
 * *On GitHub Actions*, `93d66473-JingMatrix-Vector` — the commit, then the repository the code came
 * from. Forks build the same code from the same commits, so the hash alone identifies a *revision*
 * and not a *build*, and a fork's artifact was indistinguishable from ours.
 *
 * Both halves are the *head* ones, and neither is read from the environment GitHub sets by default,
 * because on a pull request both defaults name something other than the code that was built:
 *
 * `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` is the repository that *ran* the workflow. A pull request from a fork is
 * built here, so it would stamp `JingMatrix/Vector` onto a branch that has never been near it —
 * which is exactly the artifact the name most needs to distinguish.
 *
 * `HEAD` is worse. For a pull request the runner checks out an ephemeral merge of the branch into
 * the base, so `git rev-parse HEAD` names a commit that exists in no repository, cannot be looked
 * up by anyone who reads it off a device, and is gone once the run is. The commit that was pushed
 * is the one that identifies the build.
 *
 * So the workflow passes both in: `VECTOR_BUILD_REPOSITORY` and `VECTOR_BUILD_COMMIT`, each taken
 * from `github.event.pull_request.head.*` when there is a pull request and from the ordinary
 * default when there is not — outside a pull request the two agree anyway. Absent either, this
 * falls back to what the environment says and to `HEAD`, which covers a workflow too old to set
 * them.
 *
 * *Locally*, the bare `93d66473`, or `93d66473+thinkpad` when the tree has uncommitted changes.
 * That build corresponds to no commit at all, so naming the commit alone would name something the
 * binary does not match — and whoever is looking at it is far better served by the machine it was
 * built on than by the word "dirty", since a device that has a hand-built framework on it usually
 * has exactly one candidate author.
 *
 * `+` rather than `-` for that one, in semver's sense of build metadata: after a `-` is a
 * repository that holds this exact commit, and after a `+` is a change that is in no repository at
 * all. That is the one distinction a reader of the stamp cannot afford to lose — a modified build
 * matches no release, and read as a CI build it would claim to be the release it was merely started
 * from. Neither character can occur inside a host name or an `owner/repo`, so the two shapes stay
 * apart.
 *
 * The dirty check is deliberately not applied on CI. The workflow's own "Write key" step appends
 * the signing credentials to the tracked `gradle.properties` before Gradle starts, so every master
 * and tag build reports a modified tree — every published canary has said `-dirty` for that reason
 * and no other, which sent at least one user looking for a fault that was not there (#815).
 *
 * The result goes in module.prop's human-readable version and in BuildConfig.VERSION_HASH, which
 * the manager shows on the status page. BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME is deliberately left clean.
