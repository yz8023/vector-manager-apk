/**
 * The way in to the scripted states, and the reason this whole thing is a separate source set.
 *
 * It exists only in `src/debug`, so a release build does not merely branch around it — there is no
 * such class to compile and no such activity in the merged manifest. That distinction matters more
 * here than in an ordinary app: a demo mode that could be switched on in a release build would be a
 * way to make the manager report the framework as healthy when it is not, which is the one lie this
 * app must never be able to tell. A reviewer can confirm it by looking for
 * `org.matrix.vector.manager.demo` in a release APK's classes and finding nothing.
 *
 * It hosts the app itself rather than launching MainActivity, and that is not a stylistic choice.
 * The first version did launch it, and every scenario silently did nothing: `ParasiticManagerHooker`
 * intercepts the manager activity starting and hands the *real* binder to `Constants.setBinder`,
 * overwriting whatever was bound a moment earlier. Even "no daemon at all" came up reporting a
 * healthy framework — the failure mode a test harness can least afford, since it looks like a pass.
 * Rendering VectorApp here means no manager activity is ever launched, so nothing re-binds behind
 * us.

     * which happens after this activity is constructed. That is fine — a scenario with no real
     * daemon behind it simply has empty lists, and the scripted answers are the point.

     * bind was quietly undone a moment later and every scenario reported a healthy framework. This
     * re-asserts the choice whenever something else replaces it. It settles immediately: the next
