/**

/**
 * Every panel that exists, and the order a fresh install starts with.

 * Not the order on screen: the reader's own order, and which panels they have hidden, live in
 * SettingsRepository under `nav_panels` and are modelled by NavPanels. What is declared here is the
 * catalogue and the default.
 *
 * Hiding a panel never removes it from this file. The back stack persists NavKeys by class name —
 * NavKeySerializer resolves them with a bare `Class.forName` and has no fallback — and NavDisplay's
 * entryProvider throws for a key it was never given, so a saved stack naming a panel that had been
 * deleted would be a crash rather than a stale tab. Hiding is a fact about the navigation
 * container, and about nothing else.
