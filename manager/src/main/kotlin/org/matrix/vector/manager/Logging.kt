/**
 * The manager's logging, which exists because the platform's own quietly loses stack traces.
 *
 * `android.util.Log.e(tag, msg, tr)` does not print `tr` when anything in its cause chain is an
 * [java.net.UnknownHostException]. This is deliberate upstream — `printlns` in AOSP's `Log.java`
 * breaks out of the cause walk with the comment "this is to reduce the amount of log spew that
 * apps do in the non-error condition of the network being unavailable" — and
 * [Log.getStackTraceString] returns `""` for the same reason. The message still prints, so nothing
 * looks wrong; only the trace is gone.
 *
 * For an app whose network use is a DoH resolver, a module store, and a GitHub feed, that filter
 * removes traces from precisely the failures worth reporting. Its worst case was `dns: DoH lookup
 * of $host failed` — OkHttp's `DnsOverHttps` signals failure by throwing `UnknownHostException`, so
 * the one log line whose entire purpose is explaining a DNS failure was the one guaranteed to
 * arrive without a trace.
 *
 * So the trace is formatted here and appended to the message, and only [Log.println] — which has no
 * filter — is called. Nothing in the manager calls `android.util.Log` directly; [Constants.TAG]
 * belongs to these three functions.
 *
 * The conventions the tag used to carry:
 *
 * `logcat.cpp` routes any tag beginning `Vector` into the daemon's **verbose** stream, so with
 * verbose logging on everything logged here appears in the Verbose tab beside the daemon's own
 * lines and travels in the zip export — the place a reader already looks. A file-local tag would be
 * ordinary Android practice and would land nowhere; there are none in this app.
 *
 * A message is `area: lowercase phrase naming the operation and its subject`, where the area is one
 * of ipc, dns, apps, modules, backup, restore, scope, store, update, feed, status, framework, logs,
 * actions, report, splash. The subject matters: "modules: enable of $packageName failed" can be
 * acted on, "failed to enable module" cannot.
 *
 * The `Throwable` is always the last argument — never `e.message`, which discards the stack.
 * Nothing secret is ever interpolated: no SAF `Uri` beyond its authority, no third-party query
 * string.
 *
 * Levels are [logE] when something the user asked for did not happen and nothing else will explain
 * it, [logW] for a degraded path recovered from, and [logI] for a one-off milestone worth having in
 * a bug report — counts, versions, the endpoint chosen. `d` and `v` are not offered, because
 * release builds ship them.
 *
 * A [kotlinx.coroutines.CancellationException] is never logged. Navigating away from a screen
 * cancels its scope, and a log that fires every time someone presses back is a log nobody reads;
 * any `runCatching` or broad `catch` that can see one rethrows or skips it first.
