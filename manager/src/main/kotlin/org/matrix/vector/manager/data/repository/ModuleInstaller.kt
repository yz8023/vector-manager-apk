/**
 * Downloads a release asset straight into a `PackageInstaller` session.
 *
 * **Straight into**, with no temporary file, and not as an optimisation. Parasitically the
 * manager's manifest is never installed, so it has no `ContentProvider` and therefore no
 * `FileProvider`; `ACTION_INSTALL_PACKAGE` with a `content://` URI is not available at all.
 * `PackageInstaller.Session.openWrite` is the one path that works identically in both modes, and it
 * needs no storage permission.
 *
 * **The consent story differs sharply between the two modes, and that is why the caller's own
 * dialog matters.** Parasitically the manager runs inside `com.android.shell`, which holds
 * `android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES` — so the commit below installs a third-party APK with no
 * system confirmation whatsoever. Standalone, the same code produces the usual
 * `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` prompt. In the mode most people run, Vector's own confirmation is the
 * *only* consent gate there is, so it must name what is about to happen before anything is
 * downloaded. See ConfirmInstall, which asks the platform which of the two modes it is in.
 *
 * The session's package name is pinned to the catalogue entry's, and the platform fails an install
 * whose staged APKs are inconsistent with it. A module page therefore cannot install a package
 * other than the one it advertises.
