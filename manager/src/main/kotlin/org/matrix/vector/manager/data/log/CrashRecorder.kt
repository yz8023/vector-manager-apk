/**
 * Keeps the manager's own crashes where the log export already looks for them.
 *
 * The daemon captures the manager's logcat output — `logcat.cpp` routes any tag beginning `Vector`
 * to the verbose stream, so `VectorManager` lines land in the Verbose tab beside the daemon's own.
 * It captures the manager's *crashes* too, since the same filter admits `LOG_ID_CRASH`. Both,
 * however, only while verbose logging is switched on and only while a daemon is alive to do the
 * capturing — and neither is true in the case that matters most, which is a manager crashing on a
 * device whose framework is not activated.
 *
 * So the trace is written to disk first, and the platform's own handler runs afterwards. The
 * system dialog still appears, the tombstone is still written, `logcat -b crash` still has it.
 *
 * The trace is formatted by [stackTraceOf] rather than `Log.getStackTraceString`, which returns
 * `""` for any [java.net.UnknownHostException] cause chain and so wrote header-only files for every
 * crash on the network path — the class of crash this exists to catch.
 *
 * **The directory is not a choice.** `FileSystem.getLogs`, which builds the zip the log screen
 * exports, already collects two of them:
 * ```
 * addDir("crash_shell",   File("/data/data/${'$'}{MANAGER_INJECTED_PKG_NAME}/cache/crash"))
 * addDir("crash_manager", File("/data/data/${'$'}{DEFAULT_MANAGER_PACKAGE_NAME}/cache/crash"))
 * ```
 * Those are this process's `cacheDir/crash` in each of the two ways the manager can run —
 * parasitically inside `com.android.shell`, or standalone. Writing here means a crash travels in
 * the export with no new binder call, no daemon change, and no second place for anyone to look.
 * One file per crash, named for the epoch millisecond it happened at: a crash loop produces several
 * within the same second, and a name coarser than that would have each one overwrite the last.
 *
 * Two properties matter more than anything this class does:
 *
 * - **It never throws.** It runs inside a process that is already dying, on a thread whose stack
 *   just unwound. An exception here would replace a diagnosable crash with an undiagnosable one,
 *   so every step is wrapped and failure is silent by design.
 * - **It always delegates.** The previous handler is captured and called even if the write fails.
 *   Parasitically this is not our process — it is `com.android.shell`, and quietly swallowing that
 *   process's crashes because the manager happened to be open would be far worse than losing a
 *   trace. For the same reason it records whatever crashes, ours or not, rather than trying to
 *   guess whose stack frame it is looking at.
