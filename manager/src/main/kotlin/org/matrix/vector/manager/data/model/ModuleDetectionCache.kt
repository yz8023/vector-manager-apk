/**
 * Remembers which installed packages are modules, so the answer is computed once per APK.
 *
 * Deciding whether a package is a module means opening its APK — and its splits — as a zip and
 * looking for a marker entry. On the device this was written against that is 363 packages and 193
 * split APKs, roughly 550 zip opens, and uncached the Modules panel pays it in full on every visit
 * rather than only the first.
 *
 * The answer only changes when the APK does, so it is keyed by the package's version code and
 * install time. A package that has been updated re-inspects itself; everything else is a map
 * lookup. That makes the expensive scan a one-off after an install or an update rather than a
 * per-visit cost, and it is why the cache is persistent: a cold start would otherwise pay the full
 * 550 again.
 *
 * It lives in the cache directory on purpose. Losing it costs one slow scan and nothing else, so it
 * is never a source of truth and never needs migrating.

 * What separates one scope entry from the next inside a field.

 * NUL, because a package name cannot contain one and the scope list is Base64'd into a
 * tab-separated record where a space or a comma would be ambiguous. Written as an escape rather
 * than as the byte itself: a raw NUL in source is invisible in an editor, invisible to grep, and
 * one whitespace-normalising tool away from silently changing the file format.
