     * ## The algorithm
     *
     * The cursor is the commit date of the oldest commit held, and each request asks for commits at
     * or before it — `until=`, not `page=`. Page numbers are the obvious choice and the wrong one:
     * they are relative to the tip, so a single new commit landing mid-walk shifts every boundary
     * and silently skips or repeats a page. A date is absolute. The cost of that choice is that
     * the boundary commit comes back again on the next request, which is harmless because the
     * archive is keyed by SHA.
     *
     * The *commit* date, not the author date, because that is what `until` filters on and the two
     * are not the same — about half of the newest hundred commits here differ, by as much as three
     * weeks. A cursor on the author date would ask for commits before a moment that had already
     * passed for some of them, and they would never be seen again.
     *
     * A date cursor has one failure mode, and this repository has it. Squashes and imports stamp
     * many commits with the same second — 100+ of these share `2023-02-26T08:48:49Z` — and a plateau
     * wider than one page is a wall the cursor cannot climb: every request returns the same hundred,
     * and the walk stops a fifth of the way through history believing it is done. So when a page
     * fails to move the cursor, the walk pages by number *within that timestamp* until it does.
     * Numbered paging is safe in exactly this position and nowhere else: the window is anchored by
     * an `until` in the past, so commits landing now fall outside it and cannot shift it.
     *
     * Completion is an *empty* page, and nothing weaker. "Nothing new in this page" is what the
     * plateau produces on every request, and "fewer than a hundred" is what a shared boundary
     * second produces legitimately; neither means the history has run out.
     *
     * ## Why it stops early
     *
     * An anonymous client gets sixty requests an hour and a few thousand commits is thirty of them.
     * So this fetches a handful of pages and returns, leaving the cursor on disk for the next call
     * — from the next launch, or from the reader scrolling towards the end of the list. A history
     * that assembles over a few sessions is fine; one that spends someone's entire rate limit in a
     * single launch, and then leaves the store empty for an hour, is not.
     *
     * Returns the number of commits genuinely new to the archive.

     * Every published build, both channels, newest first.

     * The canaries here are **prereleases**, not Actions artifacts, and that is the whole point.
     * GitHub gates an artifact download behind an account even for a public repository —
     * `actions/artifacts/<id>/zip` answers 401 to an anonymous caller, while a release asset answers
     * 206 — so sourcing canaries from artifacts would mean asking every would-be tester for an OAuth
     * grant to work around a storage decision. CI attaches the same zips to a rolling
     * `canary-<versionCode>` prerelease, and this reads those, so nobody signs in to anything.
     *
     * A canary is recognised by its tag rather than by being a prerelease: a hand-cut release
     * candidate is also a prerelease, and it is not a nightly.
     *
     * One fetch for both channels because they come from the same endpoint, because deciding which
     * channel a reader is on needs to see both — a canary that has aged out of the rolling five is
     * still recognisable by being *newer than the newest stable release*, and that comparison is
     * impossible with only one of the two lists in hand — and because the canary list is this same
     * answer filtered, not a second question.
