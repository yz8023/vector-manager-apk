/**
 * This app's answer to "which language, and which are on offer".
 *
 * The mechanism -- providing a configuration and a context down the tree so every string
 * re-resolves without an activity restart -- is the shared library's, because both managers need
 * exactly the same one and a second copy of it is a second place for it to be wrong. What stays
 * here is the binding: where the choice is stored, and which languages this app is translated into.
 *
 * The list is taken at build time from the resource folders that carry our own `strings.xml`, so a
 * language appears the moment a translator's folder lands and nobody maintains a list by hand.
 * Deliberately *not* `AssetManager.getLocales()`: it reports every locale any dependency ships a
 * resource for -- AndroidX alone contributes dozens -- along with the pseudo-locales, so the picker
 * would offer Afrikaans, Azerbaijani and "Éñĝļîšĥ" in an app that has none of them.
