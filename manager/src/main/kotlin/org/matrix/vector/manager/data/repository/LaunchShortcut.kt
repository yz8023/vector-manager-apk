/**
 * The launcher entry for a manager that is not installed.
 *
 * Vector normally runs *parasitically*: the manager APK is injected into `com.android.shell`, so
 * nothing about it is installed and the launcher has nothing to show. There is no icon to tap, and
 * short of dialling the secret code or going through the root manager's action button, no way to
 * open it at all — which is what #815 reported, and it is not a bug so much as a feature that was
 * never carried over when the manager was rewritten in Compose.
 *
 * A pinned shortcut is the answer the platform gives for this: the host publishes it, the launcher
 * keeps it, and it survives the manager not existing as a package. What it points at is an ordinary
 * activity of the host, marked with the [category] below — [ParasiticManagerSystemHooker] watches
 * `resolveActivity` for exactly that category and rewrites the resolution to run the manager's code
 * in its own process. Drop the category and the shortcut opens whatever the host would have opened.
 *
 * None of this applies once the manager is installed as an app, where the launcher has a real icon
 * of its own; every entry point here is guarded on [isParasitic].
