/**
 * Several module updates, installed one after another.
 *
 * One at a time is not a simplification. `PackageInstaller` sessions are independent, but a phone
 * asked to install four APKs at once spends the whole time contending for the same disk and, in
 * standalone mode, stacks four system confirmation dialogs on top of each other in an order nobody
 * chose. Sequential is also what makes the progress line truthful: there is exactly one download to
 * report on at any moment, which is what [ModuleInstaller] already models.
 *
 * It lives outside the sheet that starts it, on the application scope, because updating four
 * modules takes longer than anyone will keep a bottom sheet open. Closing the sheet is not a
 * cancellation, and reopening it finds the run where it left off.
