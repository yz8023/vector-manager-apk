     * A second launch while the manager is already up.

     * Installed normally, `launchMode` is `singleTop`, so tapping a notification reuses this
     * activity instead of starting another one and the new intent arrives here rather than at
     * [onCreate]. Without this the app would stay on whatever it was already showing and the
     * notification would look broken.
     *
     * Parasitically that is not guaranteed and this may never run. `ParasiticManagerSystemHooker`
     * answers the resolution with a copy of the com.android.shell host activity's `ActivityInfo`,
     * overriding only its process name, theme and flags, so the launch mode the system works from
     * is the host's rather than this manifest's, and the daemon's `openManager` adds only
     * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`. That is why nothing about the deep link is decided by which of the
     * two callbacks ran: [DeepLink] judges the destination instead, and both paths lead there.
     *
     * [setIntent] is not bookkeeping. The platform leaves `getIntent()` answering the intent this
     * activity was created with — `Activity.onNewIntent`'s own documentation says so and points at
     * this call — so without it every later recreation would re-offer the *first* notification's
     * module, long after a second one moved the reader somewhere else.
