/**
 * Hand-rolled service location, deliberately not a DI framework.
 *
 * The manager normally runs *parasitically*: `ParasiticManagerHooker` injects `manager.apk` into
 * the `com.android.shell` process, so this app's `AndroidManifest.xml` is never installed. Nothing
 * declared in it exists at runtime — no `ContentProvider`, therefore no `androidx.startup`, and no
 * guaranteed custom `Application`. Anything that self-initialises through `InitializationProvider`
 * silently never runs. Everything here is therefore initialised explicitly and lazily.
 *
 * Initialisation order is not fixed either. The daemon may call `Constants.setBinder()` before the
 * activity exists, or the activity may start before any binder arrives. [attach] and [bind] are
 * both idempotent and safe in either order; nothing here throws because the other half has not
 * happened yet.
