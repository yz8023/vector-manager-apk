/**
 * The Store's data: the online catalogue, and what this device already has of it.
 *
 * **The mirror list is two lists, and that is not an oversight.** The full `modules.json` is served
 * by exactly one host today: `modules.lsposed.org` answers that path with a 403. Per-module
 * `module/<package>.json` *is* served by both hosts, so the public site is a real fallback there
 * and only there. Merging these two lists back into one would quietly take the Store offline.
 *
 * **Caching is declared, not hoped for.** Every request states its own freshness, so the 16 MB disk
 * cache in `HttpClientFactory` is actually used: the catalogue revalidates against the server's own
 * ten-minute `max-age` and its ETag, pull-to-refresh forces the network, and when every mirror
 * fails the same request is replayed against the cache alone. That last step is why a cold start
 * with no network renders the last known catalogue rather than an error, and it is also what gives
 * the DNS-over-HTTPS setting an effect here, since the shared client is the one carrying the DoH
 * resolver.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no snapshot file** of our own, unlike `GitHubRepository`. The OkHttp
 * cache already holds these exact bytes; a 1.2 MB duplicate in the same cache directory would buy
 * nothing but a second thing to keep in sync.
