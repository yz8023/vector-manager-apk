/**
 * Why the daemon refused a scope write, as far as the manager can see it.
 *
 * The daemon answers a refused `setModuleScope` with a bare `false` — no reason travels back.
 * The reasons it does have are on its side of the wire: the log line it writes ("fixes its
 * scope; refusing to add …"), and the module's own `staticScope` declaration, which the manager
 * reads from the module APK the same way the daemon does. Both are carried here so the refusal
 * can be shown as an answer rather than a failure: [staticScope] with [beyond] explains the
 * common case (a module that fixes its own scope), and [daemonLog] quotes the daemon's own
 * words when root can reach its log directory.
