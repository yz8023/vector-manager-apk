/**
 * Who to thank for each language.
 *
 * Deliberately a reviewed file rather than a translatable string. The obvious design is a
 * `translator` key per language that whoever claims the language fills in with their own name —
 * except that a name here is rendered beside a *link*, and translation rights on Crowdin are
 * cheaper to obtain than commit rights on this repository. A URL that arrives through the
 * translation pipeline is a URL nobody reviewed, shown inside the app under the project's name.
 *
 * Adding yourself is one line in this file, in the same pull request that brings your translation
 * down from Crowdin, and a maintainer sees it. That is the whole point.
 *
 * Empty is a correct state and the rows simply carry no credit line: at the time of writing every
 * language here was machine-assisted and none of them has an author who should be named for it.
