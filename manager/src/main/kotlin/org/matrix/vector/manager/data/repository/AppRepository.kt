     * `getInstalledPackagesFromAllUsers` with `filterNoProcess = true` by asking the package
     * manager for the full component list of every installed package, several hundred of them on a
     * normal device. The scope editor asks twice at once — once from `load`, once for the module
     * packages it filters by — and with a cold cache both used to go through. That is issue #917:
     * any install or uninstall drops the cache, so the next module's scope screen ran two of those
     * enumerations against each other and sat on its spinner until they finished.
     *
     * Started on the application scope rather than the caller's, so leaving the screen part-way
     * through does not throw the work away: the next visit finds the cache warm rather than paying
     * for the same enumeration again.
     *
     * Retired by the next reader that finds it finished rather than by the job itself. A fetch that
     * succeeded has filled the cache, so the check above this one answers before the field is ever
     * consulted; a fetch that failed deliberately cached nothing, and dropping the finished job is
     * exactly what lets the next caller retry instead of joining a failure for the life of the
     * process.
