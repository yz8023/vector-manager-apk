/**
 * Canary builds: what has landed since the reader's own build, and how to go and run it.
 *
 * **Nobody signs in here, and that is what decides where the zips come from.** GitHub gates artifact
 * downloads behind an account even on a public repository — `actions/artifacts/<id>/zip` answers 401
 * to an anonymous caller where a release asset answers 206 — so listing Actions artifacts would mean
 * asking every would-be tester for an OAuth grant to work around where the zips happen to live, and
 * would lose the people who cannot reach GitHub's login page at all. CI attaches the same zips to a
 * rolling `canary-<versionCode>` prerelease, and this lists those.
 *
 * **This page chooses; it does not install.** It used to do both, badly: each row carried the zip
 * names, their sizes and an install button, all of which the build page does better — it states the
 * sizes, remembers which variant was last taken, checks the root implementation, shows the download
 * and the installer's own output. Duplicating that left no room for the one thing this screen is
 * for, which is deciding whether tonight's build is worth an evening.
 *
 * So each row answers that instead. A version code is `git rev-list --count`, and the commit feed
 * counts the same way, so the commits between two builds are exact — the rows name them, and say
 * how many were fixes. That number is the honest argument for testing: not "please help", but "four
 * of the nine commits since your build are fixes".

 * and simply do not appear when that request fails or when the running build cannot be dated. What

 * The bottom-right corner of a card, where the build's pull request lives.
 *
 * **The space is held whether or not there is a number in it.** The subject beside it wraps into
 * whatever room is left, so a slot that appeared and disappeared would re-wrap the titles from one
 * card to the next and the column would look ragged for a reason the reader cannot see.
 *
 * Its width is measured from the widest number the tracker could plausibly reach rather than
 * written down as a dp, so it is still correct at a large font scale — where a guessed width clips
 * the digits it exists to show.
 *
 * Tapping it opens the pull request rather than the build, which is the one place on this screen
 * where a reader can read the discussion, see the review and answer it.
