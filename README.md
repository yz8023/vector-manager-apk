### Introduction

Vector is a Zygisk module providing an ART hooking framework that maintains API consistency with the original Xposed. It is engineered on top of [LSPlant](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPlant) to deliver a stable, native-level instrumentation environment.

The framework allows modules to modify system and application behavior in-memory. Because no APK files are modified, changes are non-destructive, easily reversible via reboot, and compatible across various ROMs and Android versions.

---

### Compatibility

Vector supports devices running **Android 8.1 through Android 17 Beta**.

> [!TIP]
> This framework requires a recent installation of Magisk or KernelSU with Zygisk enabled.

---

### Installation

1. Download the latest release as a system module.
2. Install the module via your root manager (Magisk/KernelSU).
3. Ensure a Zygisk environment (e.g., [NeoZygisk](https://github.com/JingMatrix/NeoZygisk)).
4. Reboot the device.
5. Access management settings via the system notification.

### Developer Resources

Vector supports both legacy and modern hooking standards to ensure broad module compatibility.

*   [Legacy Xposed API](https://api.xposed.info/)
*   [Modern libxposed API](https://github.com/JingMatrix/libxposed-api)
*   [Xposed Module Repository](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo)

> [!NOTE]
> Vector supports the `libxposed` API via two git submodules: the [module API](./xposed/) and the [service API](./services/).
>
> A successful GitHub Actions build of the [master](https://github.com/JingMatrix/Vector/tree/master) branch indicates that Vector fully supports these APIs at those specific commits.
> Developers are suggested to check out the same commits as Vector.
